The inspiration for this was seeing two maps, [here](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/maps_data.htm) (CDC) and [here](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/) (HRSA), that were very good visual tools but unusable for analysis. For example, if a researcher wanted to model the affect of obesity and diabetes on the amount of people hospitalized for heart disease, they would need to manually collect the data from this map or the individual sources the map used. Instead, our group used webscraping to get the data programmatically."

    "Initially webscraping was actually the plan B to our original idea of requesting access to a restricted CDC file. We were going to apply, hopefully get access, and then use some fancy CSV parser to clean the data. But for various reasons - similar parsing had already been done, review process taking too long, etc. - we chose to scrape data from the interactive map. Truthfully, this is misleading as the webpage we actually scraped was [here](https://nccd.cdc.gov/DHDSPAtlas/Reports.aspx). The tricky thing about this webpage is that it uses ASPX. Unlike normal HTML which is static, ASPX allows the website to be interactive. This is great for normal users but difficult if the goal is scraping. While in HTML the url changes every time new the page displays new information, the url for an ASPX page does not. Therefore, the only way to access the information programmatically is to run code that simulates the necessary input for the desired information to be loaded. From there, it is simply getting the html, parsing, and other basic BS4 actions. "

To understand what it is doing, we will borrow a great explanation created by a Quora user [here](https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-Selenium-WebDriver-work) (feel free to read the hard version on your own). Imagine a taxi cab ride; there are 3 components- rider, driver, car. The rider gives instructions, the driver inputs them into the car, and the car executes. In the case of Selenium, the rider is the user, the driver is the browser driver, and the car is the browser. The user types instructions in code, the driver sends those requests to the browser, and the browser exexutes those requests. "

    "To supplement this data set, we wanted to get information on Community Health Centers. These are primary care delivery centers that get at least part of their funding from the federal government. Their purpose is to provie basic care to underserved populations. In a vey basic study, information about number of CHCs per county might be a rough but sufficient representation for how much resources are being provided to an area. \n",

    "We originally found this data available on an interactive [map](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/). And just like the CDC data there was no way to get all the data once. Luckily (or so we thought), there was an API with [documentation](https://datawarehouse.hrsa.gov/HDWDataServiceExternal/HdwDataWebServiceExternal.asmx?op=FindHealthCentersByArea) that should have given us access to that data and potentially other files from the Health Resources & Services Administration. They use a SOAP API which is different than what we used during class, and they even provided exmaple requests. But for reasons we never figured out we could not successfully query. The closest we got was getting a large XML file with elements of the interactive map page, but never the data we wanted. If we were really desparate, we probably could have used Selenium to programmatically interact with the map. However, we found the dataset available for download and took the [easy way out](https://data.hrsa.gov/data/download). The dataset contains a lot of information on individual health centers, but for our purposes we only need each CHC's county fips code to count health centers per county. "
